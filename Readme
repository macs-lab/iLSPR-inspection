This repository contains supporting materials of the paper "iLSPR: A Learning-based Scene Point-cloud Registration Method for Robotic Spatial Awareness in Industrial Manufacturing"
This project will include the following items:
1. The CAD models of a digital model library (done).
2. The ISOPR Dataset (to be done).
3. The geometric primitives used in the paper (done).

All the CAD models are in ".stl" format. The ISOPR Dataset is a pkl file.
